## Why I Found This Interesting

This article outlines a set of best practices for building scalable and maintainable web applications, especially in cloud-native and DevOps driven environments. I found it interesting because it connects software architecture decisions directly to operational reliability, deployment automation, and long-term maintainability.

The principles discussed revolve around strict separation of config from code, stateless processes, and treating backing services as attached resources—are highly relevant to modern DevOps workflows and platform engineering. These ideas reinforce why version control, CI/CD, and infrastructure automation are critical in real-world systems.

## Comment from Akshara

I think these practices will be useful this semester as we build our own web applications. I like your point about separating config and code—it shows that software development isn't just restricted to programming.
